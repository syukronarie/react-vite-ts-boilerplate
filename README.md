# react-vite-ts-boilerplate

This is a Reactjs Boilerplate using vitejs as compiler and TypeScript

Here you can clone and start your react project using vite as Next Generation Frontend Tooling.

What you can get from this boilerplate ðŸ˜€ðŸ¥³
  * compiled timing is super fast
  * well folder structured -this subjective by my opinion
  * already has typescript setup
  * got an import aliases setup
  * eslint and prettier for linter and formatter setup
  * etc
